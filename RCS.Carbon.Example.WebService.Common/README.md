The **RCS.Carbon.Example.WebService.Common** package contains classes that are shared between the Carbon web service and client applications. Client apps using the .NET software platform can use the classes directly to create a strongly-typed binding between the client and the service.

The `CarbonServiceClient` class encapsulates all web service calls with request and response values represented by strongly-typed .NET classes.

The web service is published here with traditional Swagger documentation:
